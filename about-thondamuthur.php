After realizing the limited impact of conventional medical treatments in severe mental illness, he developed a specialized interest in neuromodulation and trained in Neurofeedback in Australia, and went on to become Board-Certified in Neurofeedback by BCIA. He has trained in use of QEEG brain mapping- a novel investigative technique, which provides precision neurofeedback training, and is in the final stages of accreditation in this discipline. Due to his combined knowledge of Medicine, Psychiatry and QEEG he has a nuanced understanding of therapeutic and adverse effects of medications on the brain and uses this knowledge to provide recommendations for neurotherapy interventions. He has considerable experience in managing some of the most challenging neuropsychiatric conditions such as Obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD and Autistic spectrum disorder which are often underdiagnosed and respond poorly to conventional treatments. He has been associated with Abhasa through carrying out Neurofeedback sessions, these sessions are curated to match individual needs. Neurofeedback sessions play a major role in treating patients by giving them closure and a new perspective and this aids in recovery.</p>

After realizing the limited impact of conventional medical treatments in severe mental illness, he developed a specialized interest in neuromodulation and trained in Neurofeedback in Australia, and went on to become Board-Certified in Neurofeedback by BCIA. He has trained in use of QEEG brain mapping- a novel investigative technique, which provides precision neurofeedback training, and is in the final stages of accreditation in this discipline. Due to his combined knowledge of Medicine, Psychiatry and QEEG he has a nuanced understanding of therapeutic and adverse effects of medications on the brain and uses this knowledge to provide recommendations for neurotherapy interventions.
