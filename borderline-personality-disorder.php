                                    <p class="pt-serif">Borderline personality disorder is a mental ailment in which individuals lose their ability to regulate their emotions and establish control over them. This often results in impulsive actions impacting one’s own mental well-being and the kind of relationship one fosters with others. They tend to feel anxious, stressed out, and isolated because showing adverse emotions towards others would distance people from them. Worse, they are also at a higher chance of suicide, and they indulge in activities that are harmful to themselves, say driving recklessly on the road as a mode to show frustration or anger. With effective treatments, the symptoms of the disorder can be managed. 


                                        <br>The blog describes the intricacies of borderline personality disorder, BPD symptoms and signs, and shares tips and insights on how to quit BPD.

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">BPD symptoms and signs</div>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Individuals with <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder">undergo acute mood swings. Their feelings for others can oscillate to extremes; sometimes they are extremely affectionate, and at other times, there is an intense dislike. Their interests change swiftly. This impacts the quality of their relationships, be it with family, friends, or at the professional podium. People affected by borderline personality disorder are uncertain about their own thoughts, emotions, and actions. They are vulnerable to viewing things at their extreme; either they are so optimistic to imagine things turning out to be too good or they are so pessimistic that they imagine adverse happenings and bad circumstances. They sometimes act recklessly and impulsively.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder.</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">The disorder can be identified and diagnosed through careful medical examination by mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers. The professionals conduct an interview, discuss the BPD symptoms, and analyse them. The medical professional may also discuss the problem with the family members to figure out their long-term behavioural changes and to understand if there is a family history associated with the disorder. The chances of diagnosing the disorder are relatively low for people under the age of 18. The disorder is generally diagnosed in early adulthood.


                                        <br> Some co-occurring disorders make the diagnosis harder, in turn making the treatment process even harder. This is due to the overlap of symptoms. The co-existing ailments include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse.

                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder.</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">If you are wondering how to quit BPD, it is certainly important to seek treatment and follow it as soon as the disorder is diagnosed. Inadequate treatment may develop chronic mental illness, and the longer the delay in getting the treatment, the person may find it difficult to change his or her lifestyle. The challenges of treating the disorder have been overcome by evidence-based treatments. The treatment would be effective only when taken from a licenced and experienced professional. It may even turn dangerous otherwise. Prescription medicines are not usually recommended to treat BPD disorders as their benefits are still unknown. Yet, medications are prescribed to treat co-occurring disorders like depression and mood swings. Medications can cause side effects in a few people. Support from family members speeds up recovery. 


                                        <br>Two types of psychotherapies are used to treat people with borderline personality disorder. Psychotherapy is also called ‘talk therapy, which includes one-on-one or group sessions with an experienced medical professional. Group sessions motivate the person to genuinely interact with others. This might move them out of their confined sphere and allow them to express themselves effectively.

                                    <ul class="ul">
                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i><b>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</b><br>
                                            <span>This treatment assists individuals in changing inaccurate self-perceptions. They realise the beliefs and behaviours that cause the disorder. Upon interaction, the solution to these problems can be figured out. This therapy allows the affected person to handle their mood swings and anxiety effectively.

                                            <span>The DBT teaches the concept of mindfulness to the affected. It increases awareness of oneself, or, in other words, motivates the individual to embrace mindfulness. They delve deeper into their current situation and understand their emotional state. This therapy is specially devised for those with BPD symptoms. This empowers the individual with the skills and abilities to handle and build relationships, control emotions, and reduce self-harming behaviours.

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Families play an important role in shaping our attitudes and behaviors. When therapies and counseling sessions are initiated by the family, the treatment becomes more effective. Family members can offer a helping hand to the person suffering from BPD disorder. Relatives shall train themselves and develop skills to look after and understand a person with BPD disorder. Appropriate care should be provided to them. Therefore, therapies focusing on helping family members overcome and understand the hindrances of caring for someone with BPD should be provided.

                                        <br>If you are looking for ideas on how to quit BPD disorder, we suggest that you put in efforts to learn about the BPD order and try to understand what the person is undergoing and why he is behaving abnormally at times. Offer them the needed emotional support. Deal with them with patience. Encourage them through the treatment process, and make it a point to never demotivate or ridicule them. Have patience; the recovery takes time. Make the person speak out, break their barriers, and do things that have the power to uplift their mindset. Seek counselling for yourself and motivate the family members to take it up.
