                                        <p class="pt-serif">Individuals with undergo acute mood swings. Their feelings for others can oscillate to extremes; sometimes they are extremely affectionate, and at other times, there is an intense dislike. Their interests change swiftly.

People affected by borderline personality disorder are uncertain about their own thoughts, emotions, and actions.

                                                            <br><span>People of today are so ensconced in their homes that they do not spend as much time with nature as our ancestors were doing. Nature can be the best doctor. Taking a stroll in a pleasant place can instantly amp up your mind, and doing this constantly on a regular basis can turn out to be beneficial to your mental and physical health. The kind of solitude and fresh air that nature offers has the potential to release happy hormones, lower your stress, boost your immunity, and make you feel good. Living a life in harmony with nature improves your health holistically. If you are looking for how to feel happy, spending ample time with nature works.</span>

                                                            <br><span>Flocking emotions and keeping them within oneself can be overburdening most of the time. It is often necessary to stay in touch with your loved ones and vent your thoughts. This can make you feel relaxed and calm. Reach out to your loved ones, talk with them, and build a healthy relationship, as loneliness can turn your fate bitter. Speak out to people with whom you feel comfortable. This way, you can easily move on from what’s troubling you and find an answer to your question of how to feel happy.</span>

                                                            <br><span>As the eminent saying goes, ‘Health is wealth’, taking care of one's health is vital and almost indispensable. Staying fit with a proper exercise routine, consuming a balanced diet, and getting good sleep are the keys to staying healthy. Eat nutritious food and make sure that your intake has a lot of fruits and vegetables, pulses, and cereals. Remember to stay hydrated and breathe deep. Improving your physical health can boost your mental health and happiness.</span>

                                                            <br><span>Show compassion to yourself and try to limit the responsibilities you shoulder for yourself. Too many responsibilities can hamper your mental peace. It may also affect your productivity as an individual. Like living one day at a time, do one task after another. Asking for help when you are in need doesn’t lower your worth. Learn to focus on priorities. Being able to manage your to-do list is the best thing you can do to keep up with the time and promises, as well as to make yourself happy. Further, too many to-do tasks may induce a guilty feeling when you cannot complete them. This makes us refrain from taking a rest. This impacts one’s confidence, self-esteem, and happiness.</span>

Adding variety to your life would excite your mind and lift your spirits. Repeating the same activity every day as part of work may bring boredom. It is not interesting to shed focus on one particular thing every day. Spice up these activities by doing things you love in between. So get involved in some interesting activities that are different from your career. Work towards achieving a <a href="https://www.sparringmind.com/be-happy/" target="_blank">work-life balance.</a> You may choose to play your favourite sport, take up art or craft sessions, or do anything that keeps your euphoria going.</span>

                                                            <br><span>Laughter releases the happy hormone endorphin, which in turn makes a person feel happy and warm. Laughter is proven to reduce blood pressure. It calms your mind and helps you to recover from stress, anxiety, and depression. We inhale and exhale deeply while we laugh, and this induces a blood gush in the body, akin to the stimulation that happens when a person jogs. The contraction and expansion relax the abdominal muscles. This aids in boosting a positive mood and favours weight loss. There are several reasons why laughing is therapeutic. It relieves the person from chronic pain, boosts immunity, and strengthens the heart. 10 to 15 minutes of hearty laughter every day can boost your health.

                                                            <br><span>Alcohol is falsely assumed to be a de-stress beverage, whereas in actuality it is a depressant. Cutting out alcohol intake completely is hard, as alcohol consumption brings about dependence. People face withdrawal symptoms when they abruptly quit drinking. Though it is hard to entirely cut down, such a habit can be given up step-by-step on a compromise basis. Control yourself and try to refrain from drinking on a regular basis. It is advised to get professional assistance to decide the safe alcohol consumption limit based on the condition of your physical and mental health.</span>

                                                            <br><span>If you are on the lookout for ways to stay happy, help others, essentially because we derive a higher level of satisfaction when we help others. Many individuals define happiness as being selfless and being able to make others happy. Human beings are social creatures; being compassionate and altruistic releases endorphins in the brain. These endorphins mitigate the pain and soothe the stress. The act of solicitude prompts a longer life span. Show kindness in simple ways. It needn’t be fancy, big, or elaborate. Simple acts like leaving a thank-you note, appreciating people for their accomplishments, complimenting friends, or feeding stray dogs can really make a difference. These acts make you a better person and also create a commendable outlook on yourself.</span>

Having a decent number of choices is appreciable, yet it instills a sense of guilt about selecting the less preferable one. We become prone to regrets. It is also advised to reduce non-critical decisions. Make steps to limit the time you spend deciding between alternatives. By doing this, we hold the anchor to controlling our lives. If you are looking for ways to stay happy, then it’s time to limit the decisions that you make.</span>
