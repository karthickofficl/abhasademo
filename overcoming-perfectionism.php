                                        <p class="pt-serif">A perfectionist is someone who has no heart for mistakes and intends to do things with no flaws and utmost perfection. Perfectionism is often related to personality traits as it is more about the behavior of a person who aims to perform all their activities with high precision. In other words, they intend to be perfect all the time. Any standard that is short of perfection is disapproval for them and they refuse to accept it. Perfectionists get habituated to setting high expectations that often lead to stress, depression, and anxiety. A good thing about them is that they are always organized and reliable. Perfectionists run rounds of self-evaluation to attain desired outcomes. They strive to be flawless at work. 

                                        <br>The blog describes in detail the signs of a perfectionist disorder, treatment options available to help people overcome perfectionism and the anxiety that follows, and techniques for perfectionism prevention at the early stages.
                                        <br></p>
                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">Perfectionist disorder</div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Perfectionism is positive when it is regulated properly and stays under control. When perfectionists do not achieve the intended results or arrive at the level of perfection that they expect, they get hard on themselves. This puts them in a state of depression, anxiety, and other negative emotions. This impacts the physical and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323323">mental health</a> of the individual in the long run. Studies evidence the fact that a lot of times, perfectionists achieve far lesser than what other people tend to achieve. Perfectionist disorder also takes a toll on their personal and professional relationships. This can serve as a starting point for several psychological disorders including eating disorders, sleeping disorders, anxiety, low self-esteem, and so on.
                                            <br>
                                        With proper therapies and counseling, perfectionism can be regulated and the person can be trained to set realistic expectations, and more importantly to detach themselves from such expectations. This becomes easy when the perfectionist becomes more open and realizes that they are driven by a pursuit to get rid of mistakes rather than achieving their goals, which in turn is the perfectionist disorder. Overall, positive and regulated perfectionism is motivating and when perfection goes out of control, it becomes a disorder.</p> 


                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">What are perfectionistic strivings?</div>
                                                <p class="pt-serif">People with Perfectionist disorder set higher targets and unrealistic goals that are almost impossible to achieve ever. The unmet goals make people feel like they are constantly failing or falling short. Perfectionists subject themselves to self-criticism even when goals and targets are met. They worry about the least speck of mistake. They are extremely concerned about perfection. Perfectionists demand more and more of themselves, often beyond what they are capable of offering. This results in unnecessary stress. They fear failure, making mistakes, and tend to feel insecure all the while.</p>

The traits may be inherited because they can be passed on genetically from parents to children. Perfectionism can also be assimilated from being inspired by the behavior of other perfectionists.</li>
                                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Parenting style acts as a strong influencer of perfectionism. Parents with harsh and over-demanding parenting styles raise perfectionist children. Children assume that coping with high expectations is the condition to be loved and accepted. Parents who neglect, abuse, or stay harsh with their children intending to draw high achievements from them, instill perfectionist behavior. A strong and secure parent-child bond can moderate or lessen the impact of perfectionism. Children subjected to this kind of critical parenting style become emotionally deprived. They isolate themselves from society and tend to be introverts with trust issues.</li>

Healthy perfectionism improves performance as this can act as a motivating factor. Perfectionistic strivings are all about the desire to grow, improve oneself and achieve realistic goals. Individuals with healthy <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323323">perfectionism</a> set achievable and realistic goals. Once their intended goals are achieved, they get to feel proud. They limit their self from accepting more criticism. Tolerating unanticipated mistakes, acceptance of unfavorable circumstances and adaptability to change are a few attributes of healthy perfectionists. During therapy sessions, these traits can be clearly explained to people following unhealthy perfectionism and they shall be motivated to transform their perfectionistic attitude into a healthy one.</p>

                                                <p class="pt-serif">Perfectionism is good in the sense that it can motivate people and push them to achieve their goals and never give up until they achieve perfection. Perfectionism can be constructive when an excess of it is limited. Here’s what one must follow to regulate perfectionism, achieve perfectionism prevention, and ensure good mental health.</p>

                                                            Practicing self-compassion helps a person tolerate their mistakes and be kind to themselves. This further boosts a person’s mood, performance, and the way they interact and socialize with others. When you are more compassionate you pay more heed to your feelings, needs, and wants.

Divert your attention and get rid of the habit of overanalyzing decisions and regretting mistakes and flaws. Don’t think of it over and over. Self-criticism is basically an exaggeration as it nurtures critical and judgmental thoughts. Stop comparing yourself to others and all these would improve your self-esteem in the long run.

Flexibility is a vital skill. Try to expose yourself to situations you usually avoid. Accept the fact that it is a human tendency to commit mistakes and there is nothing wrong with it. Mistakes and failures are a way to learn about life. Deriving values from mistakes and leveraging them to lead our day-to-day life is an effective strategy.
