                                    <p class="pt-serif">Anger is a spontaneous response that we develop over experiences that are not so pleasing. As much as it is natural, failing to handle anger can take a toll on your mental and physical health. It distorts the ability of an individual to make decisions, and there are chances that he or she misses out on fruitful opportunities. An outburst disturbs the quality of their personal and professional relationship. You may be sending emails in a bad tone. You may be screaming at your kids. You may be yelling at your colleague for no reason. Beyond disturbing the people around you, it could deteriorate your life on a personal front.

                                        <br>Controlling and managing anger is not about learning to never get angry. It is about understanding that anger is a natural emotion and learning ways, tips, and hacks to control anger and the aggressive behaviour that follows.

                                        <br>This blog presents tips and tricks to take control of your anger, with the ultimate objective of improving the quality of your life and that of the people around you. If you are on the lookout for how to control anger issues, this blog is a must-read.

                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">1. Take time for yourself</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Take small breaks in between the days, more so whenever you are stressed out or frustrated. Taking time to reflect on what is happening might help you calm down, feel at peace, and be better prepared to handle moments that are not in your favor. If you are searching for a way to control anger immediately, this helps.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">2. Listen to your favorite song</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Music helps sort out anger. Playing a piece of soothing, soulful music can divert your mind and excite your soul. Plug in earphones and let your mind dance to the tunes. Sing loudly if needed, and this would help you douse the flames of anger.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">3. Do not talk when you are angry</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">When your mind is fuming in anger, stop talking because there are chances that you may lose control and go beyond what is considered appropriate. Also, taking some time to react would indeed give you extra time to listen, calm down, and think. Because words are powerful, it is good to take some time before you react or talk. This helps when you are looking for ways to manage anger effectively and protect yourself from getting into unwanted issues.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">4. Maintain a journal</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">If you are looking for ways to control anger issues in the long run, writing is better than speaking or reacting when you experience something that is not so pleasing. Whenever you write, you give your mind time to think rather than react on the spot. Also, writing would anchor better anger management as you get an opportunity to sit back and reassess your emotions at a later stage.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">5. Show gratitude all the while</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Taking up gratitude writing as a practice is a long-term anger management solution. Recalling things that you have and being thankful for all of them each day would get you into the habit of looking at positive things all the time. Try this, and you will find an answer to how to control your anger.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">6. Take a walk</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">When you endure unpleasant experiences or not-so-favourable situations, taking a walk would help. You would feel calm, and your mind would feel calm as you relaxed and breathed fresh air from outside. If you are searching for how to control anger immediately, taking a walk works wonders.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">7. Practice forgiving</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Learning to forgive is an essential virtue, if not for somebody else, but for your own sake. This is important so you get productive in what you do rather than contemplating unpleasant circumstances.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">8. Explore creative options</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Transform your anger constructively. Divert this towards things that are of interest to you: gardening, pottery, painting, singing, or writing. This would distract your angry mind, calm your fuming soul, and improve the overall health of your mind and body.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">9. Repeat phrases that calm your mind</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Repeating words like relax', ‘this is temporary’, ‘all is well’, or ‘you will be ok’, would help you rewire your mind and channel your focus. Find a phrase that calms your mind and relaxes your body.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">10. Look for alternatives </div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Explore options that help distract your angry mind. If something makes you angry, change the way it is done. Say, for example, that rushing to the office switches off your mood and makes you angry. Look for ways to sort this out. Starting 5 minutes early might help. This is a simple, doable activity that could help douse your anger in the long run. This is a perfect solution to how to control anger immediately.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">11. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Before you let someone’s action put you in an angry state, pause for a minute and put yourself in the shoes of the person in front of you. When you delve deeper to understand what instigated the other person to do what he or she did, introspecting what pushed him to behave this way could calm your mind and soul.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">12. Do not hold the grudge</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">If someone is instigating your anger constantly, be it on the personal or professional front, it is good to have an open conversation with them. Tell them what went wrong and how you would want to sort this out. You can take some time to express what and how you feel about the person's activities. Instead of holding the grudge and waiting for opportunities to display your frustration, this helps sort out anger in the long term.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">13. Pen a letter</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">If you are finding it difficult to express yourself in person, try writing a letter or communicating through email. When you do so, you have the opportunity to modify your thoughts before you send them. A lot of times, we feel bad for saying something after we do so. But writing gives you the opportunity to read through it multiple times and check if it is in perfect alignment with your values and virtues. You may also choose to delete the letter if you wish.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">14. Work out solutions</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Instead of pondering over problems and getting angry over something that is not in your hands, work out solutions that might help you get rid of the problem and the negative emotions that follow. Always remind yourself that getting angry might not solve any of your problems. Get realistic and work out appropriate solutions. For example, if waiting in the mad rush of traffic gets you angry, work out ways to avoid it. You may consider an alternative route or start earlier to avoid peak-time traffic and have a peaceful journey.

                                    <p class="pt-serif">When something unanticipated or unpleasant happens, try distracting your focus from your body. Stretch your muscles and take a mild walk. This might ease the stress in your body and slow down your angry breath. Stretch muscle by muscle, calm your mind, and take slow breaths. If you are looking for how to control anger immediately, this works magic.
