                                        our leading addiction specialists, therapists, and medical personnel are issuing a stern warning against the use of cannabis. This warning follows the release of recent statistics in Ireland indicating alarmingly high hospitalisation rates for cannabis strains with increased potency. The lack of warning labels puts customers at risk of mental health repercussions and other unknown concerns due to marijuana's illicit status.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        There is growing concern about the situation, particularly regarding the impact on young people who may be experimenting with these substances for the first time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        It is not only anxiety that you must be concerned about. There has been a substantial and alarming increase in self-harming behaviour and suicidal ideation among users of these higher strains. In addition, there is an increase in medical conditions associated with cannabis abuse, including <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/depression/treatment-centre-hyderabad/">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/generalized-anxiety-disorder-treatment-in-mumbai/">anxiety</a>, and cardiac palpitations. People experiencing their first episodes of drug-induced psychosis, a frightening and serious condition characterised by symptoms including depression, anxiety, exasperated agitation, hallucinations and paranoia, rage and hostility, and psychosis, are also frequently seen.

                                        Cannabis is one of the most commonly abused substances in India, despite the persistence of numerous misconceptions about its dangers. This drug, also known as marijuana or weed, is derived from the cannabis plant, and sure, it is addictive. Over time, your brain adapts to the drug's compounds to the point where higher doses of the drug are required to achieve the same effect.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        If you routinely use cannabis and experience withdrawal symptoms and cravings for the drug when you are not using it, you may be addicted to cannabis.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Detoxification entails a medically supervised setting in which patients can withdraw from cannabis use. Medications that counteract the unpleasant effects of withdrawal and help keep away the anxiety that often comes with it are substituted for the original substance. Patients in need of more extensive care have access to residential rehabilitation—inpatient treatment services that are available around the clock. Daycare is a flexible option used to support a patient's ongoing recovery after they've completed either residential treatment or outpatient treatment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Patients who opt for the least intensive level of care, known as "outpatient therapy," attend a Priory hospital or clinic once a week for a predetermined number of one-hour appointments. Individual and group therapy are only two of the many treatment options available to Priory's patients. Personal concerns that may have contributed to your addiction can be addressed and coping mechanisms developed in the safe and confidential setting of individual therapy.

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">The Link Between Stress and Substance Abuse</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Long-standing research has proven the correlation between stress and the desire to consume addictive substances. There is much evidence supporting a connection between psychological adversity, trauma, persistent suffering, and addiction susceptibility.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        To conclude, experiencing excessive levels of stress can lead to substance abuse and addiction in some individuals. Alcohol and medications such as tranquillizers, benzodiazepines, opiates, and hallucinogens frequently contain chemical constituents that change the effects of stress. These medications can temporarily replace stress sensations with anything from numbness to exhilaration.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        The difficulty is that the stress persists. Chronic alcohol or drug usage is a severe problem if the individual does not develop alternate coping mechanisms. It is well established in the scientific literature that persistent stress is a risk factor for addiction.
                                    </p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">The origins of cannabis dependency</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        If you suffer from untreated mental health disorders like anxiety or depression, or if you have trouble interacting socially or professionally, you may find the relaxed mood that cannabis provides appealing. If you need cannabis for basic needs like eating or sleeping, you may have formed a dependency on the substance and will need help breaking free from it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Although the likelihood of being addicted varies from person to person and some people can use the substance without becoming dependent, the potency of the high can be affected by factors including the amount of THC consumed. Some cannabis strains have significantly more THC than others, and some experts believe that using potent cannabis strains may increase the risk of addiction. Because different cannabis strains have different elimination rates, users may notice different effects.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Even though 10% of people who try <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/cannabis-addiction-treatment-in-mumbai/">cannabis</a> will end up addicted, there are still those who insist it's harmless and even beneficial. The risk of becoming an addict increases to 16% if you start using cannabis in your teens, and the long-term damage to your mental health increases as more and more of the drug is consumed to obtain the same results.
                                    </p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Other factors that may play a role in determining whether you develop an addiction to cannabis include the following:</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Addiction runs in families, so if a parent, sibling, or child has battled substance abuse, it raises the risk that you, too, may develop an addictive personality and a dependence on cannabis.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Environmental factors Having a troubled childhood may increase your risk of addiction as an adult, possibly because you'll want to regain some of the control you felt you were denied. It's more likely that you'll become addicted to drugs if you start using them at a younger age, such as in a peer group when in high school or college.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">
                                        Self-medicating with alcohol or substances like cannabis is a common coping mechanism for people who are already battling with the psychological effects of a mental illness. Addiction and other mental health issues, such as depression, may develop if this approach is taken.
                                    </p>
