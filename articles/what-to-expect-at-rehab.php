                                    <p class="pt-serif">Inpatient rehab, also known as residential therapy, is when a patient lives at a rehab centre for
                                        the duration of their treatment program rather than returning home each night. It is regarded
                                        as a higher level of care and has the highest success rate for all levels of addiction. Patients
                                        admitted to an <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/about-maharastra/">inpatient rehab program</a> should anticipate staying for at least a month and will
                                        almost probably complete two major phases of care during that time. These are known as
                                        detoxification (detox) and residential care, and they function well together to treat a substance
                                        use disorder.</p>


                                    <p class="pt-serif">Each community member works together to achieve for a better life during detoxification
                                        and, more importantly, residential care, gathering support from one another while also
                                        learning more about themselves. The extent to which a patient receives this experience is
                                        determined by the length of their stay and may extend beyond basic therapy to learn skills
                                        unrelated to addiction, but rather based on general life enhancement. Many inpatient rehab
                                        clinics, for example, provide job training to their patients in order to improve their future
                                        work possibilities.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">What to Expect During the Recovery Period</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">The initial stage of treatment is known as detox, and it is what distinguishes inpatient rehab
                                        from outpatient rehab. The goal here is to break the patient&#39;s immediate physical dependence
                                        by denying them access to their preferred substance and for the related withdrawal symptoms
                                        to pass spontaneously. Without the proper assistance, this phase might be impossible for a
                                        patient to complete, and withdrawal can represent a major threat to their health depending on
                                        the degree of addiction and the substances involved. Fortunately, when the patient is managed
                                        in a rehab centre, they will receive 24-hour medical monitoring and support, ensuring their
                                        safety and well-being above all.</p>


                                    <p class="pt-serif">Following the completion of the <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/detoxification-addiction-treatment-in-mumbai/">detoxification</a> process, the patient will begin the transition
                                        into residential treatment. The therapeutic modalities used during this phase of care will be
                                        determined by the needs of the individual and what is most conducive to their recovery. A
                                        patient can expect to work with a primary therapist to discover the underlying causes of their
                                        addiction and learn how to deal with potential roadblocks to long-term recovery.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Individuals can expect to participate in a variety of therapeutic modalities, holistic
                                        approaches, and recreational activities in addition to traditional clinical strategies. Individuals
                                        who receive a well-rounded treatment experience have a more successful recovery journey.
                                        Family therapy, relapse prevention, life-skills training, health and wellness, yoga,
                                        biofeedback, trauma counselling, gender-specific groups, outdoor leisure, and many other
                                        ways are examples of these approaches.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">While detox is frequently regarded as the most challenging aspect of recovery, the tools
                                        acquired during residential treatment are critical for laying a solid foundation for a
                                        life...recovered. The clinical team will develop an appropriate aftercare plan for the patient
                                        before the end of inpatient rehab, giving them with the resources they need for continued
                                        treatment, healing, and progress. This can involve programs like partial hospitalization,
                                        intensive outpatient rehabilitation, and sober living.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Choosing a Rehab Center</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">When choosing an inpatient rehab program for yourself or a loved one, keep in mind that the
                                        individual will be staying on-site for around 30 days. As a result, it is critical that the facility
                                        they choose provides a comfortable setting, as well as the treatment strategy and ancillary
                                        services required to effectively serve their needs.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">When researching different treatment programs, keep the following questions in mind:</p>
                                    <ul class="ul">
                                        <li class="pt-serif">1. What forms of addictions are treated at this facility? <br>
                                            This is critical since not every recovery facility is equipped to treat a wide range of
                                            addictions.</li>
                                        <li class="pt-serif">2. What forms of therapy are available? <br>
                                            There are numerous traditional and unconventional therapeutic alternatives, and each
                                            person will respond to them differently. The treatment process consists of a number of

                                            The first step in a lifelong journey toward recovery is treatment. A carefully thought-
                                            out aftercare plan is essential for a patient&#39;s sustained success, especially with shorter

                                        <li class="pt-serif">4. What certifications and permits do the rehabilitation facility hold? <br>
                                            To give its patients the best care possible, rehab facilities should be chosen carefully.
                                            They should have reputable accreditations and licenses, such as a JCAHO
                                            certification, as well as highly qualified staff.</li>
                                        <li class="pt-serif">5. What are the costs and the various payment methods? <br>
                                            When considering rehab facilities, a potential patient should be sure to learn about the
                                            payment options offered and whether their insurance will cover the cost of care. To
                                            aid with the cost, several rehab facilities also provide scholarships and in-house
                                            payment options.</li>

                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Most inpatient rehab programs utilize similar strategies to provide detox and care to their
                                        patients. Outside of the specific amenities for each rehab centre, the main difference between
                                        inpatient programs is simply the duration of them. At a minimum, a patient should expect
                                        their time on–site to last about a month. Many rehab centres go further to offer longer
                                        programs that are overall more effective and can better manage situations where a patient is
                                        struggling with co-occurring disorders. The time frames that a rehab centre may offer
                                        inpatient care options include:</p>
                                    <ul class="ul">
                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>fewer than 30 days</li>

                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>a year to 90 days</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Usually, the length of a person&#39;s treatment will determine how effective that care is. But
                                        because every person is unique and has unique requirements and circumstances, taking part in
                                        a long-term inpatient program might not be feasible. Therefore, it is crucial that such people
                                        have a well-thought-out aftercare plan that provides them with the tools they need to continue
                                        their recovery efforts following treatment.</p>
