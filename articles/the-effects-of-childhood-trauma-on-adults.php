                                    <p class="pt-serif">Traumas that occur in a kid's early years are frequently minimised or neglected; after all, if the youngster cannot recall or explain the incident or set of events, do they matter? The response is an emphatic "yes." Approximately fifty percent of young toddlers are exposed to some form of trauma. For some, a traumatic incident has no lasting effects, but for others, it can have lifelong repercussions. Even neonates are susceptible to the negative effects of stress on their mental and physical health.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">It may manifest during pregnancy. In addition to physiological difficulties such as low birth weight, the stress axis of the child is imprinted pathologically when a pregnant mother experiences stress or trauma. In addition to the epigenetic susceptibility to emotional and physiological factors, stress during pregnancy can be a factor in tracing the origins of problems. Additionally, numerous forms of potentially stressful occurrences in early life are known as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). They consist of:</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Why does it only affect some of them?</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Why does it matter? Stress is personal. If a child is loved and cared for, feels safe, and has a lot of support, the negative effects of stress may be cancelled out by the good things. Also, children have different ideas about what is scary. What is scary for one child might not be scary for another. There are a number of things at play, such as genetics, the support of family, and having been through trauma before.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Also, a child needs a little bit of stress early on so that they can learn how to deal with it in a healthy way. But stress that lasts for a long time can change the structure of the brain and cause long-term damage if it is not treated. some of them but not others?</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">What effects does stress in early life have on a person as an adult?</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Some traumas can leave scars, especially if they happen when a person is young and aren't talked about. A lot of ACEs can cause toxic stress, which changes a person's brain and nervous system, metabolism, immune system, and heart system.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Physical effects</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Early stress exposure can make you more likely to get heart and lung diseases, diabetes, liver disease, and cancer. Autoimmune disorders, stroke, and high stress levels, in general, are also more likely in adults who were exposed to long-term stress or trauma as children.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Emotional effects</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Long-term stress or a traumatic event can also affect mental health, and some of the things that can happen to adults who experienced trauma as children are:</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Stress and trauma in childhood can have long-term effects. Even if an adult doesn't remember a traumatic event, it can still hurt them. People who have had bad things happen to them when they were young are less likely to have good relationships as adults. They might be less likely to trust people and get close to them. Many of the problems they face, like having low self-esteem, having trouble solving problems, having trouble sleeping, not being able to make plans, or getting angry easily, have their roots in their childhood. They affect both how well people get along with each other and how well they do at work. Also, adults who didn't get help for their bad childhood experiences are more likely to expose their own kids to ACEs.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Attachment styles and how people get along</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">If a baby's caretakers don't pay attention to him or her properly and consistently, he or she may develop an attachment disorder that lasts into adulthood. In fact, some studies have found that how responsive a baby's caretaker is to the baby's needs is one of the best ways to predict what kind of relationship style that baby will have as an adult. For instance, a child who feels safe with his or her parents will grow up to have healthy, safe relationships. At the same time, a child who is often ignored or even neglected by a caretaker whose style is avoidant will probably have a hard time making close friends and may even try to stay away from close relationships. A child who was both cared for and rejected by a carer with an anxious attachment style is likely to always worry that their partner will leave them and spend their time thinking about their relationship instead of being in it.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Having to deal with early events as an adult</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">People often feel the effects of ACEs much later in life. Trauma can show up as anxiety, depression, or a condition called post-traumatic stress disorder. If you were abandoned or neglected, abused physically or sexually, or grew up in a home where someone had a mental illness or used drugs, and these events are still affecting your life as an adult, they need to be talked about, even if you don't remember much about that time. Sleeping well and eating well, as well as not smoking or drinking alcohol, and making other healthy choices, like exercising, are all important.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Childhood trauma can linger in your mind and body for a long time. It can sometimes show up in your emotional and physical responses.
