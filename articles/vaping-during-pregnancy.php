However, Abhasa offers a range of measures aimed at alleviating this burden and reducing women's reliance on substances for stress relief. Addiction treatment demonstrates efficacy daily, irrespective of individual circumstances. Our primary objective is to provide assistance to you and your family and address your treatment requirements. </p><p class="pt-serif">The available literature indicates that the use of cigarettes, alcohol, illicit drugs, or the improper use of prescription pharmaceuticals among expectant mothers might result in significant adverse health outcomes for their offspring. This phenomenon arises due to the permeability of the placenta, allowing various chemicals to traverse it and consequently enabling the transmission of drugs ingested by a pregnant woman to the developing baby. Women frequently encounter numerous obstacles when seeking treatment for a substance use disorder. Several obstacles are encountered by women, including: </p><p class="pt-serif">Women frequently encounter numerous obstacles when seeking treatment for a substance use disorder. Several obstacles are encountered by women, including:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Childcare or daycare needs </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Financial struggles </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Homelessness </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Shame or guilt </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Mental health problems </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Support from family or friends </li></ul><div class="pr-subtitle">Substance Use During Pregnancy</div><p class="pt-serif">Substance use during pregnancy poses substantial risks to both the expectant mother and the developing fetus. The effects of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, or prescription medications on a developing baby can range from birth defects and developmental delays to long-term cognitive and behavioural issues. Preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal withdrawal symptoms are also common consequences. It is vital for pregnant individuals who are struggling with substance use to seek immediate medical care and support from healthcare professionals experienced in treating pregnant women with substance use disorders. Early intervention and appropriate treatment can greatly reduce the risks and ensure a healthier start in life for both the mother and child. Encouraging a supportive and non-judgmental environment is crucial to helping pregnant individuals make informed choices and access the care they need to protect their health and the well-being of their unborn child. </p><div class="pr-subtitle">VAPING WITHOUT NICOTINE</div><p class="pt-serif">Vaping without nicotine has gained popularity as an alternative to traditional smoking. Unlike e-cigarettes that contain nicotine, non-nicotine vaping devices use flavouring e-liquids, or "vape juices," that do not contain this addictive substance. This option allows individuals to mimic the physical act of smoking, inhale flavoured vapour, and enjoy various tastes without the addictive properties of nicotine. While vaping without nicotine is generally considered less harmful than vaping with nicotine or smoking traditional cigarettes, it is not entirely risk-free. The long-term effects of inhaling vaporised compounds are still being studied, and some concerns exist, particularly regarding the potential risks to lung health. As such, individuals interested in vaping without nicotine should approach it with caution, especially if they have never smoked before. It's essential to stay informed about potential health risks associated with vaping and make informed choices regarding this practice. </p><div class="pr-subtitle">VAPING WITHOUT NICOTINE DURING PREGNANCY?</div><p class="pt-serif">Vaping without nicotine during pregnancy is a topic that requires careful consideration and caution. While it is generally recognised that vaping without nicotine is less harmful than vaping with nicotine or smoking traditional cigarettes during pregnancy, it is not entirely risk-free. </p><p class="pt-serif">Here are some key points to consider:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i><b>Safety Concerns:</b>Vaping without nicotine during pregnancy is a topic that requires careful consideration and caution. While it is generally recognised that vaping without nicotine is less harmful than vaping with nicotine or smoking traditional cigarettes during pregnancy, it is not entirely risk-free. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i><b>Unknown Chemicals:</b>Vape liquids often contain various chemicals, flavourings, and additives, and the safety of inhaling these substances during pregnancy is uncertain. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i><b>Lung Health:</b>Pregnant individuals should be especially cautious about any practices that could affect lung health. Vaping without nicotine may still have the potential to irritate the respiratory system. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i><b>Alternatives:</b>If you are looking for alternatives to smoking or vaping during pregnancy, it's advisable to explore non-inhaled methods, such as nicotine replacement therapy (under the guidance of a healthcare provider) or behavioural support to quit smoking altogether. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i><b>Consult a Healthcare Provider:</b>If you are looking for alternatives to smoking or vaping during pregnancy, it's advisable to explore non-inhaled methods, such as nicotine replacement therapy (under the guidance of a healthcare provider) or behavioural support to quit smoking altogether. </li></ul><p class="pt-serif">In general, the safest course of action during pregnancy is to avoid any substance use, including vaping, unless recommended by a healthcare provider for a specific medical reason. The health and well-being of both the expectant mother and the developing foetus are of utmost importance, and minimising potential risks is essential. </p><div class="pr-subtitle">IS VAPING DURING PREGNANCY SAFE?</div><p class="pt-serif">In general, the safest course of action during pregnancy is to avoid any substance use, including vaping, unless recommended by a healthcare provider for a specific medical reason. The health and well-being of both the expectant mother and the developing foetus are of utmost importance, and minimising potential risks is essential. </p><ul class="ul"><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Unknown Long-Term Effects: Vaping is a relatively new phenomenon, and the long-term health effects of e-cigarette use, including the potential risks to the developing fetus, are not well understood.</li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Chemical Exposure: Vape liquids (e-liquids) typically contain various chemicals and flavourings that, when heated and inhaled, can be harmful. These chemicals may include toxic substances and fine particles that can reach the placenta and affect foetal development. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Nicotine Exposure: Many e-cigarettes and vape products contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and poses significant risks during pregnancy. Nicotine exposure can lead to adverse outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and developmental issues in the baby. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Respiratory Effects: Vaping can irritate the respiratory system, and pregnant individuals should be especially cautious about practices that could affect lung health, as it can impact oxygen delivery to the developing foetus. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Second-hand Exposure: Vaping also exposes those around the pregnant individual to potentially harmful chemicals, which is a concern for the health of both the mother and others in close proximity. </li><li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Lack of Regulation: E-cigarette products are not as tightly regulated as traditional tobacco products, leading to variations in product quality and safety. </li></ul><p class="pt-serif">If you are pregnant and currently using e-cigarettes or considering vaping as a way to quit smoking, it is strongly recommended that you seek guidance and support from a healthcare provider. There are more established and evidence-based methods, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) under medical supervision, behavioural counselling, and support groups, that can help pregnant individuals quit smoking without resorting to vaping or other potentially risky practices. The health and well-being of both the expectant mother and the developing foetus should be the top priority during pregnancy, and minimising substance use, including vaping, is advisable for a healthy pregnancy outcome. </p><div class="pr-subtitle">CIGARETTES VERSUS VAPING DEVICES</div><p class="pt-serif">Cigarettes and vaping devices represent two distinct methods of nicotine consumption, each with its own set of health risks and considerations. Traditional cigarettes, which burn tobacco to deliver nicotine, are widely recognised as harmful due to the release of thousands of toxic chemicals, tar, and carcinogens when the tobacco is burned. Smoking is a major contributor to a number of malignancies, respiratory conditions, and heart issues.</p><p class="pt-serif">On the other hand, vaping devices, such as e-cigarettes, heat a liquid (e-liquid) to create an aerosol for inhalation. While vaping is generally considered less harmful than smoking due to the absence of combustion, it is not without risks. Vape liquids can contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, as well as various chemicals and flavourings, some of which may be harmful when inhaled. There is ongoing research into the potential long-term health effects of vaping, including concerns about lung health, cardiovascular risks, and the safety of inhaling certain chemicals. </p><p class="pt-serif">It's important to note that neither smoking nor vaping is safe, especially during pregnancy and for young people. The best approach to protecting health is to avoid both smoking and vaping altogether, particularly for those who have never used nicotine products. For those who are already addicted to nicotine, seeking professional help to quit using evidence-based methods and support systems is crucial for reducing health risks. Ultimately, the goal should be to achieve a nicotine-free lifestyle for better overall health and well-being. </p><div class="pr-subtitle">TREATMENT AT ABHASA</div><p class="pt-serif">There are several benefits to getting treatment at a drug rehab centre if you're pregnant and struggling with substance abuse. When selecting a rehabilitation facility, it is crucial to carefully evaluate several elements in order to ensure that the chosen inpatient programme encompasses all the necessary advantages to facilitate the recovery process. Opting for a location distant from one's place of origin can provide an individual with an opportunity to embark on a new beginning. The new setting provides individuals with an opportunity to progress without being influenced by previous interactions that may be alluring. Additionally, it may provide a novel beginning from a psychological perspective. </p><p class="pt-serif">Our treatment centre specialises in offering comprehensive support for the diverse range of challenges that individuals may encounter. At our women's drug rehabilitation facility, we prioritise the provision of respectful treatment to all female individuals. In the case of pregnancy coupled with substance addiction, the continuation of drug or alcohol consumption can heighten the likelihood of problems and congenital abnormalities in the developing fetus. Seeking assistance should be seen as the initial course of action. The decision to pursue recovery can present significant challenges, although, with the appropriate network of support, individuals have the capacity to transform their way of life and triumph over their addictive behaviours. </p><p class="pt-serif">For individuals encountering difficulties in utilising e-cigarettes or other vaporising devices, it is advisable to seek assistance from the professionals at Abhasa. The staff members at our facility have extensive training and demonstrate a caring approach to providing care to women who are facing challenges related to substance use disorders, encompassing the use of tobacco products as well.
