                                <div class="fl-wrap text-block">
                                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"> Fears are quite widespread among children, and thus, it is important to know the causes and therapeutic approaches to managing these concerns. Hi everyone, being an experienced human writer for quite some time now, I would be glad to join this critical and interesting discussion. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"> This is why, phobias are severe, long-standing, and unreasonable fear that can affect the childhood and further lifestyle of a child significantly. These fears can be as unique as the fear of spiders or the fear of going up tall structures or towers to generalized fears like the fear of aggregation of people or fear of the darkness. Children must be aware of these phobias, understand the signs, and have these problems resolved so that a child can be free of such fears and be normal.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">How Does Fear and Phobias Start in the Brain? </div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Fear and phobias are believed to originate from how the brain processes threats. When a child is exposed to a stressor that leads to fear, part of the brain known as the amygdala- which is in the shape of an almond, is stimulated. This leads to the secretion of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, to prepare the body for an instant “fight or flight” response. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Concerning the later evaluations of this fear, it is stated that it may become wholly ingrained and may manifest as a provocation of an irrational and disproportionate response to the extenuating stimulus. That is why it is essential to know the nervous structures’ work in more detail, especially the framework of phobias.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">The following are some of the reasons that cause phobia in Children </div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Several factors can contribute to the development of phobias in children, including: Like any other kind of anxiety disorder, several risk factors may lead to the development of phobias in children some of them are; </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Traumatic experiences: Phobia may be derived from a child, who may have been traumatized in one way or another by certain activities that may seem dangerous, for instance, a man using a crutch; due to illness this may pull the phobia of a child to the crutch since they came across a bad incident while on the sick bed. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"> Learned behavior: Children on their part can equally build phobia on how one of their relatives – a parent, for instance, will react to a specific object, or again, children themselves exposing their partners to horror movies and programs, horror stories, and other related instances. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Genetic predisposition: It has therefore been necessary for different researchers to expound that some of the forms of phobia could be hereditary hence some children could be more vulnerable to some forms of fear. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"> Environmental factors: Some scholars surmised that some factors stem from the external environment of a child leading to the development of phobias that are because of irregular and noisy families. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"> For a part, before one starts working with a child, it is necessary to find out what caused the development of a definite phobia in the child.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">This is because children suffering from the phobias present with the following symptoms: </div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">The symptoms of phobias in children can vary, but often include: Its manifestation in children differs but most of them exhibit: This is the response whereby the exposed subject gets extremely anxious or fearful of the specific stimulus. </p>
                                    <ul class="ul">
                                        <li class="pt-serif">• Avoidance or running away from the situation or thing that is feared </li>
                                        <li class="pt-serif">• The signs of stress on the physical body may be palpitation, sweating, or trembling all over. </li>
                                        <li class="pt-serif">• Difficulty concentrating or sleeping </li>
                                        <li class="pt-serif">• Stress and change of feelings </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">It is necessary to recall these signs and turn to a specialist for the issue’s treatment; otherwise, the child’s psychological and social development are hindered due to untreated phobias.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">There are major and specific approaches to play therapy applied to children with phobia: </div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">For children, play therapy is considered one of the most effective ways of delivering phobias and anxiety treatments. Carried out with peers and using particular and interesting games appropriate to children’s age, this strategy is based on confrontation with objects or situations that caused fear with the use of peers. Some of the most effective play therapy techniques include: The following are the recommendations that have been identified in the use of play therapy: </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Exposure Therapy: </b> Thus, this method of approach of the child to the object or situation which he/she is afraid of, starting with a low level of fear and gradually increasing the level of fear to the situation can help to avoid a child’s immediate response of fear. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): </b> The strategies described are aimed at assisting the children to become aware of distorted thought patterns and to change them for more positive and realistic ones. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Relaxation Techniques: </b> Therefore, by using implemented strategies of teaching the child deep breathing, visualization, or progressive muscle relaxation, the child’s anxiety level and fear can be minimized. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Storytelling and Role-Playing: </b> Children can be urged to discuss this fear by creating a story or acting a story about such fear to enable the child to deal with it. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Art and Creative Expression: </b> This can be sweet music in the children’s ears as they release their feelings through artwork, music, or play by creating something using those mediums. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Therefore, employing such play therapy can help children cope with their fears and perform the required personality development to find happiness and build a new, better life. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Phobias can be divided into several categories depending on the specifics of the stimulus They can be: Depending on the details of the stimulus phobias can be classified to several groups: </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Therefore, it should be pointed out once more that learning phobias in children can be presented in a wide range of manifestations, and the individual features of a child, his fears, and what initiates them must be under consideration here. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Some of the most common types of phobias in children include Below is the list of main, and most widespread types of phobias most often observed in children: </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Animal Phobias: </b> Other categories of SPS include arthropod phobia, the fear of dogs, cats, and other insects, and herpetophobia, the fear of reptiles. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Environmental Phobias: </b> Another type is a category of anxiety disorders that comprises specific phobias which comprises claustrophobia, hydrophobia, astraphobia which is fear of thunderstorms, acrophobia, and much more. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Situational Phobias: </b> Phobias, these may include; Chronophobia: these are mostly the worries involving the doctor. Aerophobia: this is mostly a worry of having to fly; Agoraphobia: this is fear of being in closed or busy places. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Social Phobias: </b> Some through fear are unable to speak in front of other people, for example in public speaking, or to make friends and or acquaintances for instance at school. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif"><b>Specific Phobias: </b> Behavior like escaping things like needles, blood, or specific kinds of foods. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Infants are all different and every phobia may manifest in one child in a way that is different from what is observed in another child; therefore there is a need to define the form of the phobia that a child has to come up with what may be the best treatment methods that can be assigned to that child. </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Collecting Information About a Generalized Fear and Childhood Phobia </div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">In Addition to this one wants to draw the attention of the reader to the fact that most of the fears and phobias that a child may develop are in one way or another, typical parts of the developmental process, and therefore the phobia may disappear as the child passed through his developmental stages. </p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Some of the most common fears and phobias in children include Following is some of the common fear and phobic predispositions that are noticed in children: </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Fear of the dark </div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">First signs as a sort of feeling of off balance usually described as dizziness; new assessment difficulties, including being unable to concentrate on things that took place or even events, that have already occurred; a startle reflex as an inborn reaction; fear of new situations; Fear of objects that the trauma victim wouldn’t have any reason to be afraid of; loud noises phobia. </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Separation anxiety (parent/caregiver related)</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">The phenomenon of separation anxiety is widespread with the age ranging between the half-year and three years and affecting both children and parents or other close relatives. It includes severe stress whenever a child becomes separated from a major caregiver and results in crying overtiredness, clinging manifestations in the children and worry, guilt, and concentration issues in parents.
