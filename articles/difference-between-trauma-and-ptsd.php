                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) refers to the psychological condition that arises following exposure to a distressing or traumatic event, resulting in significant emotional anguish that impairs an individual's ability to function in their daily activities. The individual may either directly encounter the occurrence or observe it taking place. Certain symptoms associated with this condition may manifest, such as experiencing recurring vivid memories of the traumatic experience, having distressing nightmares, exhibiting intense anxiety, or experiencing persistent intrusive thoughts related to the event.
                                        <br>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are typically categorized into four distinct types: intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, unfavorable alterations in cognition and mood, and changes in physiological and emotional responses. Symptoms may exhibit temporal variability or interindividual variability.
                                        <br>PTSD symptoms might appear within a month or years after the triggering incident. Women's daily lives, including social and professional interactions and romantic partnerships, may be impacted by the symptoms they experience.


                                    </p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">TRAUMA</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">It's safe to assume that everyone on Earth has been exposed to some kind of traumatic event at some point in their lives. The word "trauma" usually conjures up images of a life-threatening experience that permanently altered the victim. Everyone has the potential to experience trauma. A traumatic occurrence is one that leaves the victim feeling vulnerable, unsafe, or uncared for in some way.
                                        <br>The most crucial takeaway from studies on trauma is that everyone has the potential to recover from its effects with the right help. Female victims of trauma often don't receive the help they need, leading them to carry the resulting emotional "baggage" from one relationship to the next. Women tend to be nurturing, family-oriented, and peace-loving. This puts women at risk of reliving the same unpleasant experiences they had in previous relationships. Until a woman addresses and heals her past traumatic experiences, she will likely relive the same patterns of behavior in her romantic relationships.
                                    </p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PTSD AND TRAUMA</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">PTSD and trauma are distinct mental health conditions, despite their shared symptoms.
                                        <br>"Trauma is an emotional response to a horrible experience," according to the American Psychological Association. A person might experience more than one kind of trauma, and trauma can happen once or several times.
                                        <br>When a person goes through or observes a traumatic event, they can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the form of flashbacks, dreams, or intrusive thoughts, women will often repeatedly relive the traumatic event. They may be easily frightened, have difficulties sleeping, and experience sudden, irrational outbursts of anger, and they may avoid places that might remind them of the occurrence.
                                        <br>However, not all stressful experiences lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some survivors will acquire PTSD after the event, while others will simply experience mild or no symptoms at all. Know that you or your loved one can recover from the symptoms of PTSD and go on to enjoy a full and happy life, even though a traumatic incident may have caused them.

                                    <p class="pt-serif">In summary, trauma is the broader concept that encapsulates the emotional and psychological response to distressing events, while PTSD is a specific mental health diagnosis that may develop in response to trauma in some individuals. The fact that not everyone who encounters trauma will acquire PTSD must always be kept in mind. Trauma itself is a normal reaction to abnormal situations, and many individuals can recover with appropriate support and coping mechanisms.
                                     <br>   Understanding the distinction between trauma and PTSD is essential for both individuals who may have experienced distressing events and those who seek to support them. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of PTSD and seeking professional help when needed can make a significant difference in the lives of those affected by this condition.
