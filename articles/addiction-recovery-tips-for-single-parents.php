                                    <p class="pt-serif">As societal norms shift, it is becoming more common for parents to divorce and for single parents to assume custody of their children. Women tend to take on the role of primary carer more often than men, making them more likely to raise their children alone.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">But this isn't always the case, and single parenting can be challenging for people of both sexes. One of the most difficult aspects of being a single parent is the need to offer the same material, emotional, and physical security for one's children as one would in a married marriage. Many people see fighting an SUD as something private they must go through alone. Because of the catastrophic impacts that dangerous substances have on the user, many may fail to consider the impact on others.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Addiction in the family can have a ripple effect on everyone, including partners, offspring, and grandparents. Addiction to substances like alcohol and drugs can have both immediate and far-reaching consequences. <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/drug-rehabilitation-centre-in-tamilnadu/">Drug and alcohol</a> abuse can be a schism-maker in otherwise harmonious and supportive families. It's common for arguments to arise when family members try to interact with a drug-abusing youngster.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">There is a noticeable decline in trust. If a loved one with a substance abuse problem displays aggressive behaviour or tries to keep their disease hidden, other family members may become more wary of them. Addiction's effects can cause rifts in a marriage. As it gets more challenging to communicate, frustration levels rise. There are a few addiction recovery tips for single parents. <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/deaddiction/deaddiction-centre-mumbai/">in Abhasa Luxury Deaddiction Centre,</a> we educated the family regarding post-recovery counselling so the single parent could understand better in terms of handling the loved one.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Members of the family may see the user's suffering from the effects of drugs or the user's outbursts of wrath while under the influence of alcohol. Some people may notice that their loved ones suddenly disappear as they lose a significant amount of weight. After not hearing from a loved one for a long time, some people may find out that they are homeless or have overdosed. Relatives may experience extreme stress or resort to harmful coping methods like co-dependency after experiencing such shocks.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">However, in order to make ends meet, single parents often have to work multiple jobs and juggle many responsibilities, a situation that may be extremely stressful and exhausting. When a single parent has a particularly demanding schedule, it can be tempting to turn to drugs or alcohol as a means of self-care. But what if these methods of coping become destructive in and of themselves?</p>

                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>"A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically substantial impairment or suffering is manifested by one or more of the following, occurring during a 12-month period," reads the DSM-5's definition of substance abuse. Abuse of alcohol or drugs that leads to a chronic inability to execute essential life tasks (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household).

                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Substance abuse that persists despite the fact that it has produced</li>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">This practice of shirking duties and obligations can be devastating for single parents and their families. Addiction-related mental health problems and recurrent problems in the workplace and finances are common among addicts. Both they and their offspring are impacted by these changes. One parent's addiction is terrible enough in a two-parent family, but it may have devastating effects on a one-parent household.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Access To Treatment</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">It's obvious that a parent who is struggling with addiction has to be sober for the sake of their children, but just as there are extra challenges unique to single parenting that can lead to substance abuse, there are also unique challenges in terms of getting the help that's needed.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Some of the difficulties a single parent may encounter when seeking addiction treatment are as follows:</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Financial Challenges</div>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Addiction makes it difficult for any single parent to provide adequately for their family, but it can be especially challenging for those who are already struggling financially. The expense of rehabilitation may be compounded by the potential need for significant time away from work during treatment. The lack of a support system can be a major barrier to treatment for many single mothers and fathers.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Finding Child Care</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">A single parent is already the sole carer for their children, meaning that there is no one to fall back on if they need to <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/life-in-rehab-centre/">enter a rehab centre</a> for a month or more. While some families may be so close that grandparents or other relatives can watch the kids for a while, this is not always the case. It's important for a single parent to find someone who is willing to take care of their kids for extended periods of time because rehab can take a while to complete.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Higher Risk of Losing Custody</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">If a single parent is having trouble with their ex-spouse, admitting to having an addiction and entering rehab could offer the other parent the ammunition they need to pursue sole custody of the children. Those worried about this should know that a judge is much more likely to see a person favourably if they have completed rehabilitation for their addiction.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">The Stigma of Addiction</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Substance misuse has a negative connotation that is not well-received in the parent community. Being "outed" as an addict can be devastating for single parents attempting to uphold a certain image while still facing financial difficulties.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Lack of Treatment Options</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">While there is no shortage of treatment facilities in major urban centres, the NHS frequently makes cuts to these facilities, leaving rural residents with fewer options. If they decide they want to get help for their addiction, many single parents don't know where to turn and don't have the time to investigate and identify local treatment options.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Keep Seeking Treatment</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">There are more substantial challenges to treatment for single parents, but they can be overcome. The first step is to be honest about your addiction and tackle it head-on. If you ignore a substance misuse issue, it will only become worse over time, and eventually the authorities will have to intervene. Making the decision to attend addiction treatment is a big, positive step towards a brighter future.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">A single parent's guide to addiction recovery</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Substance abuse has a lot of social and internal shame attached to it, which hurts the mental health of people who don't get help for their addiction. Being a single parent already has a bad reputation, but it can also lead to addiction that hurts the health of the family and stops children from developing emotionally in a healthy way. Drug rehab is the only way for single dads and moms to recover from the effects of long-term drug use and provide a healthy environment for their children as they grow up.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">For anyone, getting over an addiction is a long and often windy road. In fact, recovery is a process that lasts a person's whole life. Many people who are recovering from addiction keep working on and improving their recovery even after their active addiction has ended. For single parents in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse, worrying about the well-being of their children can make things even harder. You have to make plans to make sure your kids are taken care of and loved while you are in inpatient rehab. At the same time, you're worried about things your children may have done that you think may have hurt them.</p>
