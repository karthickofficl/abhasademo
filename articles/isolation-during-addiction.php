                                    <p class="pt-serif">Many people agree that loneliness is the negative emotion one feels when their group of friends or acquaintances is inadequate. Today, more than ever before, people throughout the world are linked together thanks to advances in technology that facilitate instantaneous contact and the easy dissemination of information. These interactions and the ones we think we have with others are often cold and impersonal, without the nuance that would make us feel a sense of acceptance, encouragement, and significance.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Loneliness, measured in terms of social isolation, is increasingly seen as an epidemic in modern society, according to surveys and statistics collected by most developed nations. While social isolation is often attributed to the current notion of loneliness, there are numerous other causes. The isolation many people feel when they are left alone as infants can continue into their later years, manifesting as a lack of friendships in school and the workplace. Moving to a new place, being in an abusive relationship, ending a relationship, being divorced, or losing a loved one are all examples of life events that might exacerbate the illness. As a result of these experiences, we can be in the company of others but still feel isolated. However, feelings of isolation might be a sign of something more serious, such as a lack of  <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/social-isolation-and-mental-health-issues/">social support or a
                                            mental health issue.</a></p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Understanding Loneliness Through Treatment:</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">The basic characteristics of substance misuse are really situations that further develop social isolation and loneliness, and treatment can help uncover this possibility. As one becomes more consumed with finding and using the drug or as one becomes ill from its aftereffects, he or she may withdraw from friends and family and shirk professional and domestic responsibilities. It is possible that a person's physical, mental, and social health will deteriorate as the frequency with which they engage in these dysfunctional behaviours increases and as their substance misuse becomes more severe.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">An individual's maladaptive behaviours supporting their addiction tend to accelerate as they further immerse themselves in a lonely state of mind. Unfortunately, in these situations, the addict's loved ones often bear the brunt of their destructive actions. A person's capacity for self-care, as well as their capacity to develop feelings of love and confidence in themselves, can greatly benefit from therapeutic interventions. These things promote greater mental health and are effective in combating loneliness and pessimism. Additionally, counselling, support, and therapy sessions for the whole family are provided. Together, the addict and their loved ones can learn what causes the addict's feelings of loneliness and isolation and how to prevent the negative emotions and situations that can lead to relapse.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Coping With Loneliness in Recovery:</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">There is a strong emphasis on group therapy and other forms of social interaction during the treatment phase of the rehabilitation process. This not only helps people overcome their feelings of isolation and loneliness, but it also teaches them valuable coping and social skills. Unfortunately, even after receiving effective therapy, people who have had these conditions often face a trying period of readjustment. It's possible to prevent a relapse into chronic feelings of isolation by actively countering the transient emotions that trigger them.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Here are some proactive strategies for combating isolation during the healing process:</p>
                                    <ul class="ul">
                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Participate in post-treatment programmes. They plan to keep in touch with former programme participants and introduce them to people who can help them stay motivated and on track with their sobriety.</li>

                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>You can join Facebook groups and other online forums if you find that they are encouraging and helpful. It's a great way to network and make connections with individuals who share your interests. Leave the groups as easily as you joined them if you find they are becoming nasty or unhelpful. </li>
                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Join a new group, enrol in a course, or explore a different area of interest.</li>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Isolation During Addiction</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Is it bad to be alone when you're in recovery? It sometimes is. When we're alone, we tend to think about bad things, so it can be tempting to cut ourselves off from other people in recovery. When you're alone, it can be hard to stay motivated and keep away from the feelings of guilt and shame that are often linked to substance abuse symptoms. Loneliness causes a lot of problems for addicts in early recovery, so think about how bad it could be for someone who is not in recovery. Early on in recovery, people often feel alone. People often try to be alone to fill the void that addiction leaves. Many people turn to drugs or alcohol to deal with mental illness, emotional pain, or traumatic events. Even after getting help for drug or alcohol addiction, it can be hard to get used to a sober life.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Managing addiction recovery in isolation</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Peer support is very important for getting better. According to a 2016 article in Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation about the benefits of peer support groups in treating addiction, peer support helps lessen feelings of isolation and keeps people going with their efforts to deal with their problems. It's something that people with substance use disorders can always count on as they go through treatment and get better. They can talk to each other about what it's like to be addicted, which helps them get better.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Getting over an addiction is hard at any time, but the recent coronavirus pandemic has made it even more difficult. The current quarantine rules have made it harder for people to get to meetings and appointments in person, and they have also made it harder for people who are still getting better. But that doesn't mean that nothing can be done. If you know what makes you feel stressed, it will be easier to deal with your current situation. And it's important to know how many different ways you can still get the help you need.</p>
