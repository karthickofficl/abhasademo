                                    <h3>STEP TWO – BEGINNING THE SPIRITUAL JOURNEY</h3>
                                </div>
                                <div class="fl-wrap text-block">
                                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Step Two represents the beginning of a spiritual journey and aids in the belief that it is possible to let go of obsession and lunacy and live a happy, healthy, and fulfilling life. Step 2 is a recovery movement towards hope and faith. After admitting powerlessness and inability to control one's life in Step One, the second step provides fortitude and inspiration. To turn outside of oneself for assistance and support, one must have an open mind and the humility to recognise that it is impossible to overcome this disease on one's own. It does not matter whether we understand how this power greater than ourselves will aid us; what matters is that we come to believe it is possible.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle"> Willingness</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Spiritual growth begins with a willingness to believe, and this can be a gradual process. Personality change necessary for recovery is brought about by spiritual awakening. Believing in "a power greater than ourselves" is the first step in taking action, and as the mind begins to transform, so does the belief that a higher power can provide freedom from addiction and a life of recovery.</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">The focus is not on who or what this power is, but rather on what it can do for us. At this juncture in recovery, the most important lesson is the realisation and understanding that we cannot recover on our own and require assistance.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">"Our comprehension of a Supreme Being is entirely up to us. No one will make the decision for us. We can refer to it as the group, the programme, or God. The only stipulation is that this power is benevolent, compassionate, and greater than ourselves. We need not be religious to embrace this concept. The purpose is to allow ourselves to believe. We may have difficulty with this, but if we maintain an open mind, we will find the necessary assistance sooner or later."</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Trusting the process</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Some individuals begin by having faith in their recovery meetings and their fellow attendees. This confidence becomes a foundation upon which faith continues to grow. Trusting the procedure can be difficult at times. Numerous individuals struggle with faith and the concept of a higher power. This is completely typical. Doubt is an inherent component of faith. Your higher power will evolve the longer you labour towards a practical faith in your life.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">No limits</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">By coming to believe, we have the opportunity to regain our equilibrium. As we continue to work on this step and remain sober, we discover that no matter how long our addiction has lasted or how far our lunacy has progressed, there is no limit to the ability of a power greater than ourselves to restore our sanity.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Step One teaches us that we have no control over our addiction. We understand precisely what we are up against: a mind that tempts us to drink or use, and a body that compels us to continue drinking or using once we begin. Without assistance, we are destined to continue our addiction. We may experience periods of sobriety, but if left untreated, our minds will always convince us to consume or use again. We acknowledge to our deepest selves that we are impotent over our addiction and that our lives are out of control. So then, what should we do?</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">If we are impotent, we must locate a force that can assist us. This ability can vary from person to person. It can be the power inherent in the Alcoholics Anonymous group as a whole, the guidance of one's sponsor, or any type of spiritual power. This force is not required to be God in any conventional sense. This force can be indistinct and ill-defined. The point is that we come to believe there is a force assisting individuals in achieving sobriety.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">We gaze around at all the sober people in Alcoholics Anonymous who used to drink or use drugs like us and who were once similarly hopeless. We observe how they've evolved. We can hear their merriment. We observe their grins. Their kindness, warmth, and affection are perceptible. We acknowledge that something must be working in their lives despite their harrowing accounts of their addiction-ridden pasts.</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">If we want what those sober, content individuals have, we must do what they did. What action did they take? They completed the remaining Alcoholics Anonymous 12 Steps</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">In Step 2, we come to believe that a better, addiction-free existence is possible for us. We come to believe that there is a force capable of aiding our recovery.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">We recommend reading Step Two in the Twelve and Twelve and the chapter "We Agnostics" in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous to learn more about this step and the topic of finding a higher power.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Abhasa Luxury Rehab& the Second Step</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">In the second step, individuals are asked to discover hope for their recovery and for a better life. When feeling isolated and alone in the world at large, it can be difficult to discover this hope. It can be challenging for someone to remain sober long enough to discover hope. This is why individuals are sometimes required to pursue addiction treatment. Even the A.A. Big Book states that a person who is restless or foggy due to addiction may require medical treatment before they can devote themselves fully to working the 12 Steps.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Our mission at Abhasa Luxury Rehab is to assist individuals in establishing a solid foundation for their recovery. This begins with physical sobriety, which frequently necessitates medical detox. It is immediately followed by working the 12 steps in a residential inpatient or intensive outpatient setting. Some people benefit greatly from working through the 12 Steps in a structured, supportive, and professional setting. By establishing healthy habits in a treatment setting, a person is better able to implement them in the larger community.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Contact us at any time if you or a loved one could benefit from working through the steps in a treatment setting. At  <a href='https://www.abhasa.in/'>Abhasa Luxury Rehabilitation Centre</a>, our compassionate treatment advisors are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to help you develop a long-term recovery plan.</p>
