                                        Manic episodes are characterized by heightened moods, with individuals experiencing periods of intense euphoria and grandiosity. During these episodes, everything may seem more exciting and amplified, leading to impulsive decisions or excessive risk-taking.

                                        One of the hallmarks of mania is a surge in energy levels. Individuals may feel restless, constantly moving or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously. This restlessness can make it challenging to relax or concentrate on a single task.

                                        Some people with manic episodes report feeling less tired and needing less sleep than usual. They might find themselves feeling energized even after just a few hours of rest, leading to sleep deprivation and exacerbating the symptoms of mania.

Pay attention to changes in mood, sleep patterns, and behavior, and journaling can be an effective tool for tracking your mental state.
