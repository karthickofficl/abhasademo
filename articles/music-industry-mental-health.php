                                    The artist, as well as the manager, agent, label, and promoter, can all greatly benefit from a successful tour. Management is motivated to maximise profits when an artist is popular, but this isn't always the best course of action. Touring can be taxing on the mind and body, leading to disturbed sleep patterns. The inability to maintain relationships, control emotions, appetite, and digestion can all lead to feelings of worry and despair, which in turn can have a negative impact on physical health. Coping by using "uppers" and "downers" to ignore physiological cues. Successful people often find themselves spending more and more time alone, away from their loved ones and friends, contributing to their already prevalent feeling of isolation.

                                    Whether solo or accompanied by a group claiming to have their best interests at heart while secretly guarding their own possessions, there are both exhilarating and crushing moments in a performer's career. Many people have extreme nervousness right before going onstage, and many have a hard time relaxing afterward. Performers who strike a chord with their audience often report feeling overwhelming feelings of adulation and joy. When the curtain falls, the audience may be met with a totally different world. Introverts typically become good musicians, spending lengthy periods of time in isolation while creating and making music during the creative process.

                                        <p class="pt-serif">
                                        A musician's sense of worth and identity are inextricably linked to the quality of their creative output. When one's self-worth is predicated so heavily on their employment, which is itself subject to constant examination, that person is caught in a never-ending pendulum. When their work is particularly impressive, they receive acclaim that propels them to even greater heights. Being constantly on the receiving end of harsh feedback from managers, peers, and listeners can leave musicians feeling anxious, depressed, useless, and full of doubt about their own abilities and the value of their music. The constant barrage of shocking and sometimes paralysing emotions can weaken a person's emotional muscles over time, making them more susceptible to mental health issues.

                                        These days, most musicians have a portfolio career, working on short-term contracts or zero-hour contracts. While the portfolio model affords creative individuals a degree of freedom, the instability of income streams can be a cause of stress for musicians trying to find their identity outside of the confines of the music industry. The inexperienced feel this tension even more because they are not sure when or where their next job will come from or how they will pay their bills. Musicians are under a lot of pressure to make a living from their art, which can lead to feelings of guilt, anxiety, and weariness and prevent them from taking breaks. Many musicians can relate to being caught in this never-ending loop that leaves them feeling more and more tired despite their best efforts.
