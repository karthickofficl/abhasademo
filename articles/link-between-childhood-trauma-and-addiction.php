                                        Childhood trauma refers to any adverse experience or event that occurs during a person's formative years, typically before the age of 18, and has the potential to cause lasting emotional, psychological, and physical harm. This can include physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect, chronic illness, the loss of a loved one, or witnessing domestic violence. The impact of childhood trauma can be profound, leading to numerous challenges later in life.

                                        Addiction is a complex and chronic disease that involves compulsive substance use, despite its harmful consequences. It can manifest in various forms, including alcohol, drugs, gambling, or even certain behaviours such as gaming or shopping. Addiction affects individuals from all walks of life and is not limited to any particular demographic. The prevalence of addiction is alarming, with millions of people worldwide struggling with this condition.

                                        Childhood trauma can take many forms, and it is important to understand the diverse experiences individuals may have endured. Some common types of childhood trauma include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, domestic violence, parental substance abuse, or being raised in a household with mental health issues. Each type of trauma can have unique repercussions for a person's mental well-being.

Furthermore, individuals with a history of childhood trauma are five times more likely to develop substance abuse problems later in life.
