                                    <h3>Is it possible for alcohol to cause panic attacks at night?</h3>
                                </div>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Alcohol consumption can induce panic attacks, while others experience extreme anxiety. However, alcohol-induced panic attacks are a serious issue that can contribute to addiction. Anxiety attacks are sudden, intense feelings of dread that manifest physically as a racing heart, rapid breathing, and profuse perspiration. Some individuals who experience panic attacks develop the anxiety disorder panic disorder. Panic attacks and panic disorder are treatable through psychotherapy and medication. Experience severe panic attacks with fear and physical reactions in everyday circumstances. Sweating, dyspnea, and a rapid heartbeat resemble cardiac episodes.</p>


                                    <p class="pt-serif">" Mr. Ramly, CEO of Abhasa Luxury Rehab, added, "I liken it to when airlines instruct passengers to put on their own oxygen masks before assisting others during an emergency. And what we've observed with CEOs is that in many situations, they don't wear masks." During bad times, CEOs have been focused on keeping everyone else afloat but have not been prepared to accept assistance for themselves. Many CEOs don't realise they have a problem until they reach the point of burnout. Six out of ten CEOs and board members who suffered mental illness during the pandemic opted for harmful coping techniques, such as  <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/drugs-alcohol-and-mental-health/">alcohol consumption</a> and <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/gambling-addiction-treatment/">gambling,</a> rather than seeking professional assistance.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">The stigma of mental health</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Another important factor stopping CEOs from seeking assistance is the stigmatisation of mental health. In corporate circles, admitting a mental illness might feel embarrassing and equivalent to a personal shortcoming. CEOs are under intense pressure to be "superhuman." Many at the top view the admission of any form of vulnerability as a sign of weakness. This pressure is typically felt both in the workplace and at home with the family. The riches, prestige, and success of the family are at stake.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">CEO Pathologies and Personalities</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Many of the world's wealthy and renowned entrepreneurs have battled mental illness throughout their lives. People who reach the pinnacle of their field typically do so as a result of their psychological challenges, not in spite of them. Aaron Swartz, co-founder of Reddit, committed suicide in 2013; he had a history of struggling with depression. Elon Musk has been candid about his mental health, tweeting about his struggle with melancholy. Musk tweeted, "Reality is characterised by incredible highs, devastating lows, and constant stress.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">"Steve Jobs, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011, had (but was never officially diagnosed with)  <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/ocd-treatment-center-in-mumbai/">obsessive-compulsive
                                            personality</a> disorder (OCPD). Jobs was a typical obsessive, according to Joshua Kendall, whose book "America's Obsessives: The Compulsive Energy That Built a Nation" contained a biopic on him, and he struggled 'on and off from anorexia, which was believed to derive from his painful adoption experience. Early adversity was a prevalent element among the idols analysed by Kendall. Observing that compulsive behaviour is part of the psychopath continuum, he concluded, "Sometimes a guy climbs to the top precisely because he is slightly insane." Dr. Michael A. Freeman et al. surveyed 242 entrepreneurs and 93 demographically comparable comparison participants in 2015. They uncovered:</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Compared to the control group, survey respondents were considerably more likely to report:</p>
                                    <ul class="ul">
                                        <li class="pt-serif"><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>(30% versus 15% in the control group) depression</li>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Personality is a component of the portrait. CEOs are shown to have a high prevalence of narcissism. Characteristics of narcissistic personalities include an inflated sense of self-importance, an obsessive need for praise, a drive for power, a lack of empathy, and the ability to manipulate others with ease. Narcissism is frequently accompanied by other mental diseases, such as borderline, histrionic, and antisocial personality disorders. Narcissists are especially motivated to advance rapidly into positions of authority. A narcissistic CEO enjoys being in the spotlight, is confident and charismatic, and can "boldly explain the company's goal."</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">The Strain to be Superhuman</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">"Keep calm and carry on" is a strain that comes with running a business, particularly when negotiating obstacles such as the pandemic. The rest of the organisation relies on the CEO to offer a steady course. Numerous CEOs disregard the warning symptoms of mental health concerns, such as worry, insomnia, and exhaustion. They resort to unhealthy quick fixes, such as increased alcohol intake, substance misuse, gambling, and self-medication. They believe that concealing their personal troubles is crucial. Families are a common source of pressure to be a super achiever.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">In an interview on anxiety for the men's magazine Esquire, IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond recalls his upbringing: "I was raised in the 1950s, and my father was a gruff, uncommunicative man. The message sent to us was "be resilient and persevere." Gelfond, having endured difficult times, now disagrees with this strategy.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">CEOs are highly successful at managing people and all elements of their businesses; therefore, they believe they should be able to manage and control their mental health.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Loneliness makes it difficult to speak.</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">It is difficult for CEOs to rely on others when they have an image of being superhuman. It might be challenging for leaders to find someone they can trust with their weaknesses. Leadership isolation is a well-known phenomenon. Prior to the epidemic, 30 percent of executives felt lonely, according to research. Another survey indicated that as many as 50 percent of CEOs experience feelings of  <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/social-isolation-and-mental-health-issues/">isolation</a> in their positions. Examining the interactions between leadership and loneliness, clinical psychologist Ami Rokach determined that leaders (educational, state, business, and organisational) experience stress, alienation, loneliness, and emotional turmoil, which can lead to health issues and negatively impact social and familial relationships.</p>
