                                    <p class="pt-serif">Depression is a mood condition characterized by chronic
                                        sorrow and a loss of interest. Depression, also known as major
                                        depressive disorder or clinical depression, affects how a person
                                        feels, thinks, and acts and can lead to a number of mental and
                                        physical difficulties. You may have difficulty performing routine
                                        day-to-day activities, and you may occasionally feel that life is
                                        not worth living. Depression is more than a simple case of the
                                        blues, and you cannot just &quot;snap out of it.&quot; Depression may
                                        necessitate long-term therapy. But don&#39;t become discouraged.
                                        Medication, psychotherapy, or a combination are typically
                                        effective treatments for depression. Although depression can
                                        occur only once in a lifetime, most people have several
                                        episodes. During these periods, the following symptoms are
                                        present for the majority of the day, nearly every day:</p>

                                        severe enough to interfere with day-to-day activities, such as
                                        jobs, school, social activities, and relationships. Some
                                        individuals may feel generally dissatisfied or unhappy without
                                        recognizing the root cause.</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Depression is not a random occurrence, and its repercussions can be severe. Fortunately, depression is straightforward to treat. During the assessment phase, we examine your symptoms and the structure of your depression. Once we have a better understanding of the factors that influence your symptoms, we can select the most appropriate treatment. Always, the first step in treatment is psychoeducation. This means that you are provided with an explanation of depression and its maintenance. You, as well as your family members, partners, and friends, will typically receive guidance on how to manage your depression.</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">You will be provided with numerous lifestyle recommendations, such as for sleeping, eating, and exercising. This will help you establish the groundwork for addressing your depression.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Activation and cognitive therapy are the two areas that you focus on during this therapy. Due to exhaustion and pessimism, depression frequently reduces participation in hobbies and social activities. While these exercises are crucial for a positive disposition,  <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/depression-rehabilitation-center-in-mumbai/">During depression treatment,</a> you are urged to
                                        gradually become more active. This is difficult since depression attempts to impede progress. But after you achieve success, you will gradually begin to feel better. You also begin to explore the veracity of your negative thoughts, which contribute to your gloomy mood. You will learn to think more realistically and constructively.</p>
                                   
                                        <p class="pt-serif">This will be practised both in therapy sessions and at home. As
                                        you have a more realistic perspective, your disposition will
                                        improve. This approach assumes that your depression is a
                                        result of your life circumstances and your response to these
                                        circumstances. We refer to this as your &quot;personal style.&quot;
                                        Depression is characterised by a distinctive style, such as
                                        perfectionism, disaster thinking, trouble setting limits, or the
                                        desire to bury one&#39;s head in the sand. In this treatment, you
                                        and your therapist will identify the events and personal
                                        characteristics that contribute to your depressive symptoms.
                                        You will gain a better knowledge of your sadness and feel less
                                        helpless as a result.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Next, you establish goals that can be focused towards
                                        symptoms, situations, or your own personality. There will be an
                                        emphasis on altering your personal style. It is not about making
                                        major changes to one&#39;s identity, but rather about toning things
                                        down. Saying &quot;no&quot; more frequently and accepting &quot;good
                                        enough&quot; can significantly alleviate depression. Everyone needs
                                        positive social relationships to feel good. IPT assumes that
                                        abrupt changes in significant interpersonal relationships might
                                        trigger depression. Such changes include the death of a

                                        significant loved one, a marital or professional conflict, or a new
                                        social role following a divorce or a career shift.</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">It is also likely that you have difficulties maintaining
                                        connections, so contributing to your sadness through a lack of
                                        social contact. This therapy examines how communication with
                                        significant person functions and how this relates to depressive
                                        feelings. Then, we address your societal issue. By developing
                                        skills such as dialogue, conflict resolution, and expanding social
                                        contacts, your interactions with people are enhanced. At the
                                        conclusion of treatment, we focus on relapse prevention.
                                        Depression recovery involves trial and error.
                                </div>
                                <p class="pt-serif">Therefore, it is conceivable that your depressive feelings would
                                    return after a period of time. This does not mean that you must
                                    start from scratch, but you must apply the therapy skills you
                                    have learnt. The most effective method to deal with a relapse is
                                    to prepare for it beforehand. In the final part of treatment, you
                                    learn to recognise the indicators of relapse and how to respond.
                                    Consequently, you can confidently conclude your therapy in the
                                    future. At <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/rehabilitation-in-india/">Abhasa Rehabilitation centre,</a> we provide a holistic
