                                    <p class="pt-serif">Everyone here at Abhasa Rehabilitation and Wellness Home practices mindfulness, giving you the tools you need to stay resilient and continue into a full recovery after you leave treatment.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">If you've been here before and need a refresher, just go back to the last time you were in a meeting room with your co-workers. Now that you're home, it might be difficult to keep up with everything, especially if you're still in the early stages of recuperation. You could be considering a career change, taking care of your family, making financial preparations, or doing all of the above! The pace of life can quicken to a frenzy at times.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Finding happiness even in adversity and speeding up the healing process can be accomplished through regular home mindfulness practice.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Meaning, "This is dreadful!" moments are included. How am I supposed to keep going? I'm going to explode! Presently, I find myself here. I can't believe I have no time for myself. I feel like I'm just scraping by, doing the bare minimum to get by. Absolute clinging to life as a last resort.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">And when I'm in survival mode, it's very challenging to practice mindfulness, to stay in the moment, and to refrain from daydreaming about tomorrow, the weekend, or any other time or event that I tell myself would be better than today. But look, this is it; this is life. and I do not wish to be absent from it.</p>

                                    <p class="pt-serif">Part of what helped me get better was rediscovering the joy in making everyday things like housework, caring for animals, and homemade meals from scratch. Living at home can be the pinnacle of mindfulness training, but we might all use a few gentle reminders to slow down and enjoy the moment from time to time. Some suggestions for home-based mindfulness training.</p>

                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">Is mindfulness possible with kids?</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">In a word, yes, but it's not easy. The days of parents, especially those of young children, are rarely quiet. Practicing mindfulness can be challenging when there is dinner to prepare, children to calm, and dishes to wash.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Although it is challenging, it is not impossible. Mindfulness practice at home with children has several advantages. Your children will learn from watching you practice mindfulness and hopefully adopt its calming, positive traits. They'll see their parents at peace and acquire the skills they need to find inner serenity, too.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Numerous studies have examined the stress-relieving effects of mindfulness meditation and mindfulness-based therapy. In a 2003 study of cancer patients, for instance, increased mindfulness was found to decrease mood disturbances and tension. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 39 studies demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapy treatments in reducing anxiety. Increase emotional well-being: Meditation and associated training have been shown to reduce anxiety and tension and improve pleasant sentiments.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">It should come as no surprise that mindfulness can also reduce emotional reactivity, given its ability to reduce tension. In a study conducted by Ortner and colleagues, practitioners of mindfulness meditation were shown emotionally distressing images and then asked to classify unrelated tones. Those with greater mindfulness meditation experience reacted less intensely to the images and were therefore better able to concentrate on the tone categorization task.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Additionally, research has demonstrated that mindfulness meditation can improve concentration. On tests of concentration, Moore and Malinowski compared a group with mindfulness meditation experience to a group without such experience. On all measures of attention, meditators significantly outperformed non-meditators, suggesting that mindfulness enhances one's ability to concentrate.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">According to another study, mindfulness may also enhance working memory. As stress has been shown to impair working memory, Jha and colleagues investigated the effects of mindfulness meditation on military participants during a stressful pre-deployment period. One group participated in an eight-week course on mindfulness meditation, while the other group did not. In the control group, working memory decreased, whereas in the mindfulness group, working memory decreased among those who spent the least time practicing mindfulness and increased among those who spent the most time practicing. Additionally, longer periods of mindfulness practice were associated with an increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Studies have also shown that mindfulness can enhance one's ability to communicate emotions and respond effectively to stress in interpersonal relationships. According to research, practicing mindfulness reduces the emotional impact of relationship conflicts and improves interpersonal communication. In the end, these skills improve relationship contentment.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">There are numerous additional advantages to mindfulness. They encompass psychological, cognitive, and even physical enhancements. Studies have demonstrated, for instance, that mindfulness can enhance anxiety modulation, intuition, and metacognition. In the meantime, there is evidence that mindfulness meditation improves information processing speed while decreasing effort and disruptive thoughts. Finally, mindfulness can result in improved immune function and an enhanced ability to manage chronic pain.</p>
                                    <div class="pr-subtitle">The drawbacks of mindfulness</div>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">Unquestionably, mindfulness has numerous notable benefits, but it is not a cure-all. Some studies indicate that cultivating mindfulness may have negative consequences. One study found that after mindfulness meditation, participants were more likely to construct false memories, suggesting that mindfulness may have unintended consequences.</p>
                                    <p class="pt-serif">In addition, another study suggested that mindfulness researchers should be cautious not to injure participants by inducing negative mental, physical, or spiritual responses. Those diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, may experience severe anxiety as a consequence of mindfulness meditation (PTSD). Those suffering from PTSD tend to avoid thoughts and emotions associated with their trauma. However, mindfulness meditation encourages emotional openness, which could lead individuals with PTSD to encounter previously avoided stressors, potentially resulting in traumatization.</p>
