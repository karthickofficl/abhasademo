                                    </div>

                                        <div class="clearfix"></div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Several studies have connected marijuana use to an increased risk of mental diseases such as psychosis (schizophrenia), depression, anxiety, and drug use disorders, although it's not always clear whether or not it causes these symptoms. Marijuana usage has been linked to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide among teenagers in sporadic and minor ways.</p>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">Marijuana has also been linked to a motivational syndrome, which is described as a lack of or lessened desire to engage in normally rewarding activities. Because of the endocannabinoid system's function in mood and reward regulation, it's been suggested that brain alterations caused by early marijuana use may underpin these relationships, but additional study is needed to confirm and better understand these links.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Cannabis has entered the conversation as a therapy for addictions to other drugs, most notably opioids, in recent years, turning the concept of cannabis and addiction on its head. It makes sense to give cannabis as an alternative to opioids if the purpose of treatment is to decrease damage. However, there is a school of thought that cannabis therapy for other chemical addictions has potential not just for harm reduction but also for treating addiction symptoms such as withdrawal and cravings. </p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Many studies of the relationship between<a href="https://www.abhasa.in/cannabis-addiction-treatment/"><b>cannabis</b> </a> use and mental illnesses such as <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/depression-rehabilitation-center/"><b>depression</b> </a>and anxiety have suffered from methodological problems by not controlling for related factors. Cannabis usage and anxiety have a complicated relationship. Cannabis is widely used for its euphoric and calming properties. When inebriated, though, some people develop worry or paranoia. As a result, cannabis may be used to treat anxiety or tension in some people while generating anxiety in others.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Early and regular cannabis usage is a contributing factor in psychosis, and it interacts with other risk factors such as the family history of psychosis, childhood maltreatment, and COMT and AKT1 gene expression. These interconnections, determine the specific role of cannabis usage in generating psychosis that would not have happened otherwise.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">The length and dose of cannabis usage increase the chance of developing schizophrenia. Regular cannabis users are twice as likely as non-users to develop cancer. When compared to non-users, those who have used cannabis at some time in their lives have a 40% higher risk.</p>

                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">What is the mechanism of action of cannabis?</div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">When you smoke cannabis, it enters your bloodstream. It will go fast to your brain and adhere to your receptors. Your emotions and behaviour will be affected as a result of this. Cannabis contains several chemical components known as cannabinoids. Two examples are cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (THC).</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">THC is the key active ingredient in the cannabis plant. The more THC in cannabis, the better the effect. THC's psychotropic effects, including hallucinations and paranoia, can be mitigated by CBD. It can also help to alleviate anxiety. This indicates that if the plant contains more CBD, the effects of THC will be reduced. </p>

                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">What are some of cannabis's nice effects? </div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Cannabis can make you feel happier, more relaxed, chatty, or laugh more than normal. Colours and audio may appear to be brighter and crisper. A 'high' is a term used to describe the pleasant effects of a substance.</p>
                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">What are the negative consequences of marijuana?</div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Hallucinations, mood swings, depersonalization, psychosis, forgetfulness, delusion, and disorientation are all possible side effects of cannabis usage. You may have trouble concentrating or memorizing things. You may learn that you are unable to sleep and are sad.<a href="https://www.asktohow.com/how-cannabis-affects-your-mental-health/"><b>You can also feel hungry or as though time is passing you by.</b> </a>  You can be lacking in motivation. Cannabis can also alter your perception of reality.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Things may seem, sound, or feel differently to you. This is referred to as hallucination. Psychosis can manifest itself in hallucinations. Psychosis is a indication of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. These are stated to as 'psychotic diseases.'</p>
                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">When it comes to psychosis and schizophrenia, what's the difference?</div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">The term "psychosis" raises to a set of symptoms or experiences that include hallucinations and delusions. When someone has hallucinations, they have a different experience than other individuals. You may be seeing objects or hearing voices.  </p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Delusions occur when someone has odd views that are not shared by others. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that impairs one's ability to think and feel. Hallucinations and delusions are mutual symptoms of <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/schizophrenia-treatment-in-tamilnadu/"><b>schizophrenia.</b> </a> Other symptoms include feeling flat or emotionless and withdrawing from other people. </p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Is cannabis a habit-forming substance?  Approximately one out of every ten frequent cannabis users develop a dependency. If you start using it in your teens or use it daily, you're more likely to get hooked. If you use cannabis frequently, you may build a tolerance to it.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">This implies that you'll need more to have the same result. If you get hooked to cannabis, you may experience withdrawal symptoms if you stop using it. For example, you could: feel angry, practice food cravings, restlessness, sleep issues, and mood swings. </p>
                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">Marijuana Treatment:  </div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Marijuana might be one of the most difficult drugs to quit up due to cultural influences. Marijuana's growing societal acceptance contributes to this, much as alcoholics' unwillingness to give up<a href="https://www.abhasa.in/alcohol-rehabilitation-centre-in-tamilnadu/"><b>alcohol</b> </a>  does. Many people with addictions may not believe they have a problem, and their loved ones may not either; yet, this does not rule out the possibility that they might benefit greatly from Marijuana addiction therapy. Many people who acquire a marijuana habit can quit without needing to go to a full-fledged treatment facility.</p>

Some people may be startled to learn that marijuana has withdrawal symptoms, although they aren't as severe as those caused by other substances. Marijuana withdrawal symptoms have been likened to Nicotine withdrawal symptoms since abstinence from either drug can cause:</p>

Many people getting inpatient treatment are there as a result of their involvement with the criminal justice system. However, some people willingly chose this therapy option.  </p>

It can be difficult to decide whether or not to seek treatment for marijuana addiction, and some people believe that therapy is unnecessary. However, the majority of people who desire to overcome addiction will not be able to do it on their own. The most essential thing to remember is that this addiction may be overcome. </p>
