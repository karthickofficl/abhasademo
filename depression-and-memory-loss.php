                                        <p class="pt-serif">Sadness and mood swings are common depression symptoms. Depression, on the other hand, is a multifaceted illness that affects many parts of life, including memory. Depressive symptoms and memory problems usually coexist in later life, making it difficult to distinguish between symptoms caused by mood disorders, preclinical or early dementia, and other geriatric syndromes. This difference is especially relevant when assessing the risk of cognitive decline in older people because both depressive symptoms and memory complaints (when an individual feels a decrease in memory functioning but performs properly on objective tests) are linked to poor cognitive outcomes.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Anxiety and depression can exist at the same time. In fact, 45 percent of patients with one mental health illness are thought to fit the criteria for two or more disorders. According to one study, half of people who suffer from anxiety or depression also suffer from the other. Although each ailment has its own unique causes, symptoms and treatments may be similar. Continue reading to find out more, including management advice and what to anticipate from a clinical diagnosis.</p>

                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">Memory loss and depression</div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">People suffering from depression have trouble recalling specific memories. This implies that sadness can influence several types of memories, such as declarative and autobiographical memories. A group of young people performed poorly in research when it came to pattern separation.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">This is the process through which the brain encodes memories of comparable experiences and stimuli. People may feel perplexed while thinking about where they've been if pattern separation is hindered, especially if they've visited multiple comparable locations. These findings support the theory that sadness might impair declarative memory, which includes remembering facts and experiences. Short-term memory loss is a side effect of depression.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Memory issues were linked to more severe depression symptoms in those who were depressed. Another study discovered a link between depression and cognitive function. <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/emotional-numbness-in-anxiety-and-depression/"><b>Depression</b> </a>  affects people's ability to pay attention and remember things. They have issues with executive function as well. The executive function is in charge of abilities that enable people to concentrate on tasks, pay attention, and self-regulate their behaviour. Another study from 2014 showed that depression might damage memory even after therapy. Persons who had previously experienced depression were more likely to remember negative words from a list than people who had never encountered despair, according to one study.</p>

                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">Depression </div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is a mental health illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and works. It is characterised by an overpowering sense of melancholy, loneliness, and despair. The illness can greatly disrupt a person's everyday life and perhaps lead to suicidal thoughts.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Depression is distinct from melancholy, loneliness, or loss brought on by a traumatic life event, such as the death of a loved one. <b>Depression may</b> occur at any moment and afflict people of all ages, colours, and socioeconomic groups. The illness affects twice as many women as it does males.</p>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">According to the American Psychiatric Association, people with depression have a number of symptoms, the most prevalent of which are "a deep sensation of melancholy or a noticeable lack of interest or pleasure in daily activities."</p>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">Although the exact origins of depression are unknown, experts believe that an imbalance in the brain's signalling molecules may be to blame in many cases. However, various views exist as to what this imbalance is and which signalling molecules are involved. A range of stressful life events, including early childhood trauma, a job loss, the death of a loved one, financial difficulties, or a divorce, are also linked.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression is most likely caused by a mix of genetic, biochemical, environmental, and psychological factors. An underactive thyroid gland, cancer, heart disease, persistent pain, and other serious ailments can all cause sadness. Hormonally-caused depression can occur during delivery or throughout menopause.</p>
                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">Diagnosis</div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">There are no tests available to identify depression in the laboratory. However, there are tests that can be conducted to exclude the possibility. Blood tests may be ordered by your doctor to rule out any other diseases that might be affecting your mood. Symptoms of depression can be caused by some drugs and conditions, such as a viral infection, thyroid problem, or major hormonal changes. </p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">If your doctor cannot uncover another explanation for your symptoms, he or she may send you to a qualified mental health professional for assessment. To assess if a person has depression, doctors search for certain signs. Expect your therapist or doctor to probe deeply into your mood, behaviour, and daily activities. You'll also be asked about the psychiatric history of your family. You could be asked to fill out a depression-rating questionnaire as well. This might assist you in determining the level of depression.</p>

                                                    <p class="pt-serif">The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) consists of 21 items about depression that are self-reported. They're made to aid mental health practitioners in assessing sad people's moods, symptoms, and actions. Each response is given a value from 0 to 3 to represent the severity of the symptoms.</p>

There are additional 21 questions in all. Each one corresponds to a certain indicator or symptom of depression. Answers to multiple-choice questions are graded on a scale of zero to four. More severe depression is indicated by higher overall scores.  </p>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">Holistic therapy is the key to successful rehabilitation. It's all about assisting people in making lifestyle adjustments that will help them heal in the future. Patients in rehab are taught how to live fruitful lives that are pure, meaningful, and productive; they have a valuable commodity that they do not want to tarnish or lose.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">The purpose of any good rehab programme is to educate people on how to deal with their emotions, communicate successfully with others, and deal with the stresses of everyday life. As with chronic conditions like depression, it's recommended that you pick a <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/"><b>top rated rehab centre in india</b> </a> for treatment that combines talking therapy, psychotherapy, sessions, and depression medication. Rehab therapy usually involves a big team of therapists, medical professionals, counsellors, and clergy. Depression is usually treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Electroconvulsive treatment, or ECT, is sometimes used.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Depression is a curable disorder, and the therapy will be more effective if the problem is detected and addressed as soon as possible. People are affected by depression in many ways. Each person's experience with the illness will be unique. As a result,<a href="https://www.abhasa.in/depression-rehabilitation-center-in-mumbai/"><b>depression rehabilitation centres</b> </a> use a thorough screening method to detect symptoms and work with patients to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to their specific requirements.</p>

                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">Depression Treatment Program: </div>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Psychotherapy, medicine, or a combination of the two may be used to treat depression. Antidepressants are prescription medications that assist in changing mood by influencing naturally existing brain chemicals. Antidepressants are divided into numerous groups, although clinicians often begin with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and then go on to other medications if the patient's condition does not improve.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">According to the National Institute of Mental Health, medications take time to act, generally 2 to 4 weeks, and symptoms like hunger, attention issues, and sleep improve before patients experience mood improvements.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Psychotherapy, sometimes referred to as talk therapy or counselling, has been demonstrated to benefit certain people suffering from depression. Several studies have found that treating severe depression with a combination of psychotherapy and medication works best.   </p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">According to the National Institute of Mental Health, different types of psychotherapy include cognitive-behavioural therapy, which helps a person change negative thought patterns and replace them with healthier ones, and interpersonal therapy, which is designed to help someone understand and work through difficult relationships.</p>
                                        <p class="pt-serif">Problem-solving therapy is another type of psychotherapy that entails coming up with practical answers to difficult circumstances. </p>
