                                        <p class="pt-serif">If you or your loved one is addicted to drugs or combating substance abuse, reversing the addiction can be overwhelming for some. “How long does addiction recovery take? What is the cost of treating addiction?” remains the most frequently asked  question. The treatment for addiction depends on the type and length of addiction, and this is largely varied. The body’s response to addiction differs from person to person. The extent of the addiction, rate of dependence, withdrawal, and various other factors determine the duration and length of addiction recovery. The timeline for the treatments in India is usually fixed considering all these factors. So, if you are looking for how long is rehab for alcohol or how long is rehab for drug addiction, then reading the blog would help.</p>
                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">How long is rehab for drug addiction?</div>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">If you are looking for how long rehab <a href="https://www.abhasa.in/how-to-avoid-becoming-addicted-to-prescription-drugs/">for drug</a> then you must understand that the length of rehab for drug addiction is not predetermined. Generally, getting good outcomes takes about a month and can extend to a year. Rehabilitation centers in India offer treatment programs for one month, three months, and six months or more. At Abhasa Rehabilitation Center, we offer residential treatments, halfway houses, and living facilities to provide extended care. It is suggested that you go for the treatment duration that works best for you.
                                        <br>The duration may sometimes require that you take a break from commitments to ensure an effective cure. On an average scale, if you wish to know how long rehab for drug addiction is, then it is this: an average person needs about 90 days to get out of addiction. Almost nothing comes with haste. Thus, trying to fix the addiction quickly doesn’t actually work. Staying committed to long-term recovery helps the person become more sober and stable.
                                        </p>
                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">Do you know that?</div>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">Studies conducted by psychologists reveal the fact that about 66 days are required for the formation of a new habit. Thus, it's wise to spend about 2 months for the betterment of oneself.
                                        <br>Spending less than adequate time limits progress. The longer the person spends on the rehabilitation process, the longer the outcomes last. The time required for complete recovery can be approximately determined by analyzing the rate at which the person is reviving and recovering to normal. Giving up on the drug to which the person is addicted isn’t just like a walkover; it is hard indeed. The path is rugged, and one has to go through ups and downs to be able to accept living without drugs. A big shift is needed in the mentality of the person to get accustomed to their new self. Healing involves a lot of embracing and adapting to a new lifestyle.

                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">How long is rehab for alcohol?</div>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">Drug and alcohol addiction can be life-threatening and fatal. The toxins left behind in the body can be cleared by going through a process called detoxification. Through detoxification, the body gets rid of unwanted substances. It addresses the needs of a person who is struggling with withdrawal symptoms by eliminating physical and mental dependence on the drug and prolonging sobriety. Detoxification is effective in preventing relapse.
                                        <br>Concentration problems, sleeping issues, nausea, nervousness, and mood swings are common during detox. Putting in efforts to cope with these initial ailments consumes a lot of time.
Detoxification is usually carried out at the beginning of substance abuse treatment. Even this has to be performed gradually at a slow pace, taking ample time, as rapid detox is dangerous. 
                                        <br>Detoxing without medical supervision is highly risky. It requires medical assistance, and taking detox at home can cause severe complications and side effects. Therefore, getting aid from rehabilitation centers while keeping the social stigma away works wonders.

                                        <div class="pr-subtitle">When should we start the substance abuse treatment?</div>

                                        <p class="pt-serif">The earlier, the better. When the person starts with the treatments quicker, they generally get more time to recover. Starting the treatment early produces better outcomes. This is more important than the intensity of the treatments. Perhaps integrating additional treatments along with the scheduled treatment yields better results in the long term.</p>
